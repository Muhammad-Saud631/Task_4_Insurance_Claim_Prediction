# Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to predict medical insurance claim amounts based on personal attributes using a regression model.

## 📊 Dataset
Medical Cost Personal Dataset  
Features include:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges (target variable)

## 🛠️ Approach
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas  
2. Cleaned the data and encoded categorical variables  
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualized the impact of:
   - Age on insurance charges
   - BMI on insurance charges
   - Smoking status on insurance charges  
5. Trained a **Linear Regression** model  
6. Evaluated model performance using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Smoking status has a strong impact on insurance charges
- Higher BMI and age generally lead to higher claim amounts
- Linear Regression performed reasonably well for prediction

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Regression modeling
- Data visualization and correlation analysis
- Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
- Practical experience with real-world datasets

## 🔗 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
